            Hey there! I'm Cam, a junior electrical engineering student at Santa Clara University. This website is my way of sharing my incredible Semester at Sea adventure with my family, extended family, friends, and everyone else who finds their way here along the journey.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            When I'm not buried in circuit analysis or coding projects, you can find me running around campus, hitting the trails for a good hike, or doing anything social with friends. When I heard about Semester at Sea, I knew it was the perfect opportunity to combine my love for adventure with learning in a completely new way - studying while sailing around the world!
